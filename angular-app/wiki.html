        Lorem ipsum, or lipsum as it is sometimes known, is dummy text used in laying out print, graphic or web designs.
        The passage is attributed to an unknown typesetter in the 15th century who is thought to have scrambled parts of
        Cicero's De Finibus Bonorum et Malorum for use in a type specimen book. It usually begins with:

        “Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore
        magna aliqua.”
        The purpose of lorem ipsum is to create a natural looking block of text (sentence, paragraph, page, etc.) that
        doesn't distract from the layout. A practice not without controversy, laying out pages with meaningless filler
        text can be very useful when the focus is meant to be on design, not content.

        The passage experienced a surge in popularity during the 1960s when Letraset used it on their dry-transfer
        sheets, and again during the 90s as desktop publishers bundled the text with their software. Today it's seen all
        around the web; on templates, websites, and stock designs. Use our generator to get your own, or read on for the

        So how did the classical Latin become so incoherent? According to McClintock, a 15th century typesetter likely
        scrambled part of Cicero's De Finibus in order to provide placeholder text to mockup various fonts for a type
        specimen book.

        It's difficult to find examples of lorem ipsum in use before Letraset made it popular as a dummy text in the
        1960s, although McClintock says he remembers coming across the lorem ipsum passage in a book of old metal type
        samples. So far he hasn't relocated where he once saw the passage, but the popularity of Cicero in the 15th
        century supports the theory that the filler text has been used for centuries.

        And anyways, as Cecil Adams reasoned, “[Do you really] think graphic arts supply houses were hiring classics
        scholars in the 1960s?” Perhaps. But it seems reasonable to imagine that there was a version in use far before
        the age of Letraset.

    he decade that brought us Star Trek and Doctor Who also resurrected Cicero—or at least what used to be Cicero—in an
    attempt to make the days before computerized design a little less painstaking.

    The French lettering company Letraset manufactured a set of dry-transfer sheets which included the lorem ipsum
    filler text in a variety of fonts, sizes, and layouts. These sheets of lettering could be rubbed on anywhere and
    were quickly adopted by graphic artists, printers, architects, and advertisers for their professional look and ease
    of use.

    Aldus Corporation, which later merged with Adobe Systems, ushered lorem ipsum into the information age with its
    desktop publishing software Aldus PageMaker. The program came bundled with lorem ipsum dummy text for laying out
    page content, and other word processors like Microsoft Word followed suit. More recently the growth of web design
    has helped proliferate lorem ipsum across the internet as a placeholder for future text—and in some cases the final
    content (this is why we proofread, kids).

    Some claim lorem ipsum threatens to promote design over content, while others defend its value in the process of
    planning.

        So when is it okay to use lorem ipsum? First, lorem ipsum works well for staging. It's like the props in a
        furniture store—filler text makes it look like someone is home. The same Wordpress template might eventually be
        home to a fitness blog, a photography website, or the online journal of a cupcake fanatic. Lorem ipsum helps
        them imagine what the lived-in website might look like.

        Second, use lorem ipsum if you think the placeholder text will be too distracting. For specific projects,
        collaboration between copywriters and designers may be best, however, like Karen McGrane said, draft copy has a
        way of turning any meeting about layout decisions into a discussion about word choice. So don't be afraid to use
        lorem ipsum to keep everyone focused.

        One word of caution: make sure your client knows that lorem ipsum is filler text. You don't want them wondering
        why you filled their website with a foreign language, and you certainly don't want anyone prematurely publishing
        it.

        Coming full circle, the internet's remixing of the now infamous lorem ipsum passage has officially elevated it
        to pop culture status.
